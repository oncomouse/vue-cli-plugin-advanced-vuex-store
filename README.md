# @oncomouse/vue-cli-plugin-advanced-vuex-store

This plugin adds a more advanced Vuex store to your vue-cli projects. Specifically, it creates a store that uses [Vuex modules](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/modules.html), hot reloads those modules, and uses [vuex-persistedstate](https://github.com/robinvdvleuten/vuex-persistedstate) to persist the store's state between reloads.

## Install:

```bash
vue add @oncomouse/advanced-vuex-store
```
